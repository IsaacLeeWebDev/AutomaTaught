# MVPro
## A workflow app for Full-Stack MVP apps

### What does MVPro do?
MVPro Provides a highly opinionated workflow framework for Fullstack Engineering Students to complete their MVP projects. With MVPro, you can have all the functionality of Trello that you'd need to work on a solo project, and most of the tickets are either made for you, or made with a form so you don't have to try to remember what all the redundant full-stack app tickets that everyone needs are.

### MVP Projects are hard!
Ever heard these thoughts in your head during an MVP Project?

  "I'm writing code, but I have no idea what my app is supposed to do!"

  "I've been working on this one component for six hours... this is fine."

  "Trello? More like Trell-no"

  "Yeah, I'll just timebox this... right after I... uh..."

  (  "Wait, where was that stackoverflow article I needed for this one ticket?" )

  (  "Wait, where am I supposed to submit this deliverable again?" )

  (  "Did I forget to check one of the many sources of information on this deliverable?" )

MVPro saves you from these nightmares by providing a straightforward, opinionated workflow generator which puts your deliverables in one place, and in order!

> "Well, I'm still working on this project, and I don't have really anything valuable written yet, but at least I've got something on the page!"
